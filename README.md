Simplifies Work
A calculator is a device or a software application designed to perform mathematical calculations quickly and accurately. It serves as a useful tool for a wide range of users, from students and professionals to everyday individuals who need to perform arithmetic operations. Here's a comprehensive description of a calculator:

Key Features:

Basic Arithmetic Operations:

Addition (+): Combining two or more numbers to find their sum.
Subtraction (-): Finding the difference between two numbers.
Multiplication (*): Repeated addition, determining the product of two numbers.
Division (/): Sharing a quantity into equal parts, finding the quotient.
User Interface:

A typical calculator has a numeric keypad with digits 0 through 9.
Function keys for basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
Additional keys for special functions like percentages, square roots, and exponentiation.
Memory Functions:

Memory Recall (MR): Retrieves the value stored in memory.
Memory Store (MS): Saves the current displayed value into memory.
Memory Add (M+): Adds the current value to the memory.
Memory Subtract (M-): Subtracts the current value from the memory.
Clearing Functions:

Clear Entry (CE): Clears the current entry without affecting the entire calculation.
Clear All (C): Clears the entire calculation or resets the calculator.
